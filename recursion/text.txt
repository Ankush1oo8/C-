loop in replacement

defn: function calling itself
 why?: to solve problem which are recursive in nature
  
what are function call?
int product(int a  , int b){
    return a*b;
}
when we are writing "product(a,b)" and a,b are any number by writing this we are calling product function

fuction calling itself?
void fun(int n){
    if(n==0){
        cout<<"hello";
    }
    fun(n-1);
}
